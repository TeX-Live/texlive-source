1 Introduction
**************

This manual (dated April 2014) corresponds to the TeX Live 2014 release.

   This manual is aimed at system installers and programmers, and
focuses on how to configure, build, and develop the TeX Live (TL)
sources.  The sources can be acquired in a number of ways; see
<http://tug.org/texlive/svn>.

   This manual does not duplicate the (primarily user-level) information
found in other TL documentation resources, such as:

   * The TeX Live web pages: <http://tug.org/texlive>.

   * The web page with an overview of how to build the binaries which
     Are distributed with TeX Live: <http://tug.org/texlive/build.html>.

   * The TeX Live user manual: <http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html>, or run
     'texdoc texlive'.

2 Overview of build system
**************************

The TeX Live build system was redesigned in 2009, consistently using
Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool.  Thus
   'configure && make && make check && make install'
or the basically-equivalent top-level 'Build' script suffice to build
and install the TL programs.  The 'make check' clause performs various
tests of the generated programs--not strictly required but strongly
recommended.  Running 'configure --help' will display a comprehensive
list of all 'configure' options.

   The main components of the TL build system are:

'libs/LIB'
     Generic libraries.

'texk/LIB'
     TeX-specific libraries in subdirectories, notably LIB='kpathsea'.
     (The other one is 'texk/ptexenc'.)

'texk/PROG'
     TeX-specific programs (that use Kpathsea).

'utils/PROG'
     Other programs (that don't use Kpathsea).

   The primary design goal of the build system is modularity.  Each
program and library module (or package) specifies its own requirements
and properties, such as required libraries, whether an installed
(system) version of a library can be used, 'configure' options to be
seen at the top-level, and more.  An explicit list of all available
modules is kept in only one, central, place ('m4/kpse-pkgs.m4').

   A second, related goal is to configure and build each library before
configuring any other (program or library) module which uses that
library.  This allows checking for properties and features of a library
built as part of the TL tree in much the same way as for a system
version of that library.

   All generic libraries and several programs are maintained
independently.  The corresponding modules use (most of) the distributed
source tree and document any modifications of that source.

   All this is for the sake of simplifying both upgrading of modules
maintained independently and integrating new modules into the TL build
system.  (Not to say that either task is trivial.)

3 Prerequisites
***************

Overall, building the TeX Live programs, when using all libraries from
the TL source tree, requires only C and C++ compilers and GNU 'make'.
(If 'make' from your 'PATH' is not GNU make, you can set 'MAKE' in the
environment to whatever is necessary.)

   Indeed, GNU 'make' is required only because of some third-party
libraries, notably FreeType; all the TL-maintained directories (and
Automake/Autoconf output in general) should work with any reasonable
'make'.

   However, a few programs in the tree have additional requirements:

'biber'
     requires 'perl' for autodetection of the TL platform name.

'xdvik'
'xpdfopen'
     require X11 headers and libraries, often in "development" packages
     that are not installed by default.

'xetex'
     requires 'fontconfig' (again both headers and library).

'xindy'
     requires GNU 'clisp' and 'libffcall', and in addition 'perl',
     'latex', and 'pdflatex' to build the rules and/or documentation.

Lacking the required tools, building these programs must avoided, e.g.,
'configure --disable-biber --without-x --disable-xetex --disable-xindy'

   Modifying source files induces more requirements, as one might
expect:

   * Modification of any '.y' or '.l' source files requires 'bison' or
     'flex' to updatete the corresponding C sources.

   * Modification of the sources for '.info' files requires 'makeinfo'.

   * Modification of any part of the build system (M4 macros,
     'configure.ac', 'Makefile.am', or their fragments) requires GNU M4,
     GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake, and GNU Libtool to update the generated
     files.  *Note Build system tools::.

   If you haven't modified any source files, and infrastructure tools
such as 'autoconf' or 'makeinfo' are still being run, check your
timestamps--notably, 'use-commit-times' must be set to 'yes' in your
Subversion configuration (*note Build system tools::).  Barring buggy
commits, no infrastructure tools are needed to do a normal build.

4 Building
**********

The top-level 'Build' script is intended to simplify building the
binaries distributed with TeX Live itself--we call this the "native" TL
build.  It configures and makes everything in a subdirectory of the main
build tree (default 'Work/'), installs everything in an other
subdirectory (default 'inst/'), and finally runs 'make check'.  The
exact directory and command names can be specified via environment
variables and a few leading options.  All remaining arguments
(assignments or options) are passed to the 'configure' script.  Please
take a look at the script itself for more information; it is not
complicated.

   An alternative, and the one we will mainly discuss here, is to run
'configure' and 'make' oneself in a suitable empty subdirectory.
Building in the source directory itself is not supported (sorry).

* Menu:

* Build iteration::     What 'configure' and 'make' do.
* Build problems::      If the build fails.
* Build in parallel::   Simultaneous 'make' processes.
* Build distribution::  Making a distribution tarball.
* Build one package::   Example of working on just one program.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build iteration,  Next: Build problems,  Up: Building

4.1 Build iteration
===================

Running the top-level 'configure' script configures the top level and
the subdirectories 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk'.  Running 'make' at the
top-level first iterates over all TeX-specific libraries, and then runs
'make' in 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk' to iterate over all generic
libraries, utility programs, and TeX-specific programs.  These
iterations consist of two steps:

  1. For each library or program module not yet configured, run
     'configure', adding the configure option '--disable-build' if the
     module need not be built, otherwise running 'make all'.

  2. For each library or program module that must be built, run 'make'
     for the selected target(s): 'default' or 'all' to (re-)build,
     'check' to run tests, 'install', etc.

   Running the top-level 'make' a second time iterates again over all
the library and program modules, but finds (should find) nothing to be
done unless some source files have been modified.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build problems,  Next: Build in parallel,  Prev: Build iteration,  Up: Building

4.2 Build problems
==================

If configuring or building a module fails, you could either (a) find and
fix the problem, or (b) remove the subdirectory for that module from the
build tree, and rerun the top-level 'make' (or 'Build' with '--no-clean'
as its first argument).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build in parallel,  Next: Build distribution,  Prev: Build problems,  Up: Building

4.3 Build in parallel
=====================

The TL build system carefully formulates dependencies as well as 'make'
rules when a tool (such as 'tangle', 'ctangle', or 'convert') creates
several output files.  This allows for parallel builds ('make -j N' with
N>1 or even 'make -j') that can considerably speed up the TL build.

   Incidentally, a noticeable speed-up can also be (independently)
gained by using a configure cache file, i.e., with the option '-C'
(recommended).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build distribution,  Next: Build one package,  Prev: Build in parallel,  Up: Building

4.4 Build distribution
======================

Running 'make dist' at the top-level creates a tarball
'tex-live-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.xz' from the TL source tree.  Running 'make
distcheck' also verifies that this tarball suffices to build and install
all of TL.

   This is useful for checking consistency of the source tree and
Makefiles, but the result is not a complete or even usable TeX system,
since all the support files are lacking; *note Installing::.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build one package,  Prev: Build distribution,  Up: Building

4.5 Build one package
=====================

To build one package, the basic idea is to use the 'configure' option
'--disable-all-pkgs' (*note '--disable-all-pkgs'::).  Then all program
and library modules are configured but none are made.  However, the
'Makefile's still contain all build rules and dependencies and can be
invoked to build an individual program or library and causes to first
build any required libraries.

   This "build-on-demand" procedure is used, e.g., in the 'luatex'
repository to build LuaTeX, essentially from a subset of the complete
TeX Live tree.  Similarly, when, e.g., building the original e-TeX has
been disabled (as it is by default), one can run 'make etex' (or 'make
etex.exe') in 'texk/web2c/' to build e-TeX (although there is no
comparably simple way to install e-TeX).

   If you want to work on a single program within the TL sources, this
is the recommended way to do it.  Here is an example from start to
finish for working on 'dvipdfmx'.

     mkdir mydir && cd mydir  # new working directory

     # Get sources (<http://tug.org/texlive/svn>)
     rsync -a --delete --exclude=.svn --exclude=Work \
           tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source/ .

     # Create build directory:
     mkdir Work && cd Work

     # Do the configure:
     ../configure --disable-all-pkgs --enable-dvipdfm-x \
       -C CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g >&outc

     # Do the make:
     make >&outm

     # Test:
     cd texk/dvipdfmx
     make check

   Then you modify source files in 'mydir/texk/dvipdfm-x' and rerun
'make' in 'mydir/Work/texk/dvipdfm-x' to rebuild.

   The second line the 'configure' are invocation shows examples of
extra things you likely want to specify if you intend to hack the
sources (and not just build binaries): the '-C' speeds up 'configure',
and the 'CFLAGS' and 'CXXFLAGS' are to eliminate compiler optimization
for debugging purposes.

   Of course, one should actually look at the output and check that
things are working.  There are many 'configure' options you can tweak as
desired; check the output from 'configure --help'.

   Finally, the above retrieves the entire TL source tree (some 500mb).
It is natural to ask if this is really necessary.  Strictly speaking,
the answer is no, but it is vastly more convenient to do so.  If you cut
down the source tree, you must also give additional 'configure' flags to
individually disable using system versions of libraries, or the
intricacies of the dependencies (such as 'teckit' requiring 'zlib') will
have undesired side effects.  For an example, see the 'build-pdftex.sh'
script in the 'pdftex' development sources (<http://pdftex.org>), which
are indeed a cut-down TL source tree.

5 Installing
************

This section discusses the results of 'make install' in the source tree.

   The main consideration is that this is not enough to make a usable
TeX installation.  Beyond the binaries that are built from the sources,
(thousands of) support files are needed; just as a first example
'plain.tex' is not in the source tree.

   These support files are maintained completely independently and are
not present in the source tree.  The best basis for dealing with them is
the TeX Live (plain text) database in 'Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb',
and/or the TeX Live installer, 'install-tl'.  More information is under
'Master/tlpkg' and at <http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html>.

* Menu:

* Installation directories::    The prefix, 'bindir', etc., directories.
* Linked scripts::              Scripts not maintained in the sources.
* Distro builds::               Configuring and building for OS distributions.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Installation directories,  Next: Linked scripts,  Up: Installing

5.1 Installation directories
============================

Running 'make install' (or 'make install-strip') installs executables in
'BINDIR', libraries in 'LIBDIR', headers in 'INCLUDEDIR', general data
(including "linked scripts", *note Linked scripts::) in
'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist', man pages in 'MANDIR', and Info files in
'INFODIR'.

   The values of these directories are determined by 'configure' and can
be specified explictly as options such as '--prefix=PREFIX' or
'--bindir=BINDIR'; otherwise, they are given by their usual Autoconf
defaults:

     PREFIX                  /usr/local
     EXEC_PREFIX             PREFIX
     BINDIR                  EXEC_PREFIX/bin
     LIBDIR                  EXEC_PREFIX/lib
     INCLUDEDIR              PREFIX/include
     DATAROOTDIR             PREFIX/share
     MANDIR                  DATAROOTDIR/man
     INFODIR                 DATAROOTDIR/info

... except possibly modified as follows:

   * If the option '--enable-multiplatform' is given, '/PLATFORM' (i.e.,
     the canonical platform name) is appended to 'BINDIR' and 'LIBDIR'.
     This is implied for a native TL build.

   * In a native TL build, 'DATAROOTDIR' is set to 'PREFIX', 'INFODIR'
     is set to 'PREFIX/texmf-dist/doc/info', and 'MANDIR' to
     'PREFIX/texmf-dist/doc/man', corresponding to the directories used
     in the TL distribution.

The top-level 'configure' script displays all these installation paths.

   For the native TL build, the 'Build' script leaves the binaries in
'./inst/bin/STD-PLATFORM-NAME'.  The new binaries are not directly
usable from that location; they need to be copied to
'Master/bin/TL-PLATFORM'.  The other files and directories that end up
in './inst/' are ignored.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Linked scripts,  Next: Distro builds,  Prev: Installation directories,  Up: Installing

5.2 Linked scripts
==================

Quite a few executables are architecture-independent shell, Perl, or
other interpreted scripts, rather than compiled binaries.  A few are
maintained as part of the TL source tree, but most are maintained
elsewhere with copies under 'texk/texlive/linked_scripts'.

   These so-called "linked scripts" are installed under
'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist/scripts'; for Unix-like systems a symbolic link
is made in 'BINDIR'.  For example, a symlink points from 'BINDIR/ps2eps'
to 'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist/scripts/ps2eps/ps2eps.pl'.  For Windows, a
standard wrapper binary (e.g., 'BINDIR/ps2eps.exe') serves the same
purpose.  (The source for the wrapper is in 'texk/texlive/w32_wrapper'.)

   One reason for all this is to avoid having many copies of the same
script, but more importantly this allows invoking the same script on all
operating systems.  Furthermore, we want the 'BINDIR' resulting from the
build to be exactly what is in the TL distribution; any deviations cause
considerable extra work.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Distro builds,  Prev: Linked scripts,  Up: Installing

5.3 Distro builds
=================

Although they use the same code base, building for the native TL
distribution as shipped by the TL user groups is typically quite
different from a "distro" build needed by, e.g., a full GNU/Linux or BSD
operating system distribution.

   The native TL distribution uses shared libraries only when absolutely
necessary ('libc', 'libm', X11 libraries, and 'libfontconfig').
However, a distro typically wants to use as many shared libraries as
possible from elsewhere on the system, including TeX-specific libraries
such as 'libkpathsea' (even though Kpathsea has never officially been
released as a shared library, but we digress).  In addition, the
installation paths will, in general, be completely different.

   Here are the 'configure' options that distro builds are likely to
find most relevant:

'--disable-native-texlive-build'
     This must be specified to avoid interference from the many tweaks
     we do for the native TL build.

'--with-banner-add=/SOMEDISTRO'
     This isn't technically required, but is strongly recommended, so
     your build and your distro can be distinguished from others.

'--enable-shared'
     Build shared versions of the TeX-specific libraries (uses
     'libtool').

'--disable-static'
     Do not build the static versions of the TeX-specific libraries.

'--with-system-LIB'
     Use system versions for as many libraries LIB as possible.
     'configure --help' will give you the list of possibilities.

'--with-LIB-includes=DIR'
'--with-LIB-libdir=DIR'
     If needed, allows you to specify where the headers/code are for the
     given library LIB.

'--prefix=/usr'
'--prefix=/opt/TeXLive'
     Or whatever your convention is.  The default is '/usr/local' and
     you shouldn't install there for a distro.

'--libdir=\${exec_prefix}/lib64'
     May be needed for 64-bit bi-architecture (GNU/Linux) systems.

   You will need to take care of the support files mentioned above
(*note Installing::), and many other issues, such as font maps,
languages, and formats, independently of the build.  Norbert Preining
has written a detailed article on adapting TL for distros:
<http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb34-3/tb108preining-distro.pdf>.  (If it needs
updating at some point, perhaps we will merge it into this document.)

The TeX Live source tree is the subtree rooted at 'Build/source' of the
complete TL distribution and contains the sources for all executables
distributed by TL, as well as 'configure' scripts and 'make' rules to
build and install them together with some of their support files.

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build system tools,  Next: Top-level directories,  Up: Layout and infrastructure

6.1 Build system tools
======================

As mentioned above (*note Prerequisites::), a normal build requires very
little.  On the other hand, if you want to modify the TeX Live
infrastructure sources, such as 'configure.ac' or 'Makefile.am' files,
you will need to have several additional tools installed.

   In general, the TL build system uses the latest released versions of
the GNU build tools, installed directly from the original GNU releases
(e.g., by building them with 'configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu' and
having 'PATH' start with '/usr/local/gnu/bin').  We have found that
trying to use the versions of these tools packaged for distros causes
many extra hassles, so don't do that, tempting as it may be.

   Currently the versions we use are:

     autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.69
     automake (GNU automake) 1.14.1
     bison (GNU Bison) 3.0.2
     flex 2.5.39
     ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 2.4.2
     m4 (GNU M4) 1.4.17
     makeinfo (GNU texinfo) 5.2

   These versions should be used to update the generated files (e.g.,
'configure' or 'Makefile.in') in all or parts of the TL tree after their
dependencies have been changed.  This can be done explicitly with the
top-level 'reautoconf' script or implicitly by using the configure
option '--enable-maintainer-mode'.

   The files in the Subversion repository (see
<http://tug.org/texlive/svn>) are all up to date, but unfortunately this
may not be reflected by their timestamps.  (For starters, be sure to set
'use-commit-times=yes' in '~/.subversion/config' or the equivalent.)

   To avoid unnecessary runs of 'bison', 'flex', or 'makeinfo' it may be
necessary to 'touch' the generated ('.c', '.h', or '.info') files.  With
'--enable-maintainer-mode' it may also be necessary to 'touch' first
'aclocal.m4', then 'configure' and 'config.h.in' (or 'c-auto.in'), and
finally all 'Makefile.in' files.  Perhaps 'make -t' will help.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Top-level directories,  Next: Autoconf macros,  Prev: Build system tools,  Up: Layout and infrastructure

6.2 Top-level directories
=========================

Here is a brief description of the top-level directories in the TeX Live
source tree.

   As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter (*note Overview of build
system::), the main source directories are 'texk/' (TeX-specific
programs and libraries), 'utils/' (additional programs), and 'libs'
(generic libraries).

   The top-level directories 'am/' and 'm4/' contain 'Makefile.am'
fragments and Autoconf macros, respectively, used in many places.
Specifically, the file 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4' contains lists of all program
and library modules; missing modules are silently ignored.  (This helps
in creating cut-down source trees.)

   Each module contributes fragments (in separate files) defining its
capabilities and requirements to the 'configure.ac' scripts at the
top-level and in the subdirectories 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk'.  The
fragments from program modules supply 'configure' options to disable or
enable building them; those from library modules specify if an installed
(system) version of that library can be used.  This ultimately
determines which modules need to be built--although all modules must be
configured for the benefit of 'make' targets such as 'dist' or
'distcheck'.

   The top-level 'build-aux/' directory contains the common files
'compile', 'config.guess', 'config.sub', 'depcomp', etc. for most
packages, pulled from the GNU Gnulib sources
(<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib>), which in turn synchronizes with
the appropriate ultimate upstream repository.  There are, however,
independent copies in, e.g., 'libs/freetype2/freetype-*/builds/unix/',
and similar places.  The 'reautoconf' script does not touch those, but a
TL cron job keeps them in sync (nightly).

   The directory 'extra/' contains things which are not part of the TL
build, but are present for convenience, e.g., 'epstopdf' developed here
and 'xz/' required by the TL installer.

6.3 Autoconf macros
===================

Here we describe some of the Autoconf macros used in several modules-not
a complete list, by any means.  These general macros are supplemented by
module-specific macros in directories such as 'texk/dvipng/m4/'; some of
those are described in *note Library modules:: and *note Program
modules::.

6.3.1 General setup macros
--------------------------

The TL sources use two general setup macros:

 -- Macro: KPSE_BASIC (NAME, [MORE-OPTIONS])
     Initialize the basic TL infrastructure for module NAME:
        'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign MORE-OPTIONS])'
        'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE'
        'KPSE_COMPILER_WARNINGS'
     and make sure the C compiler understands function prototypes.  This
     is used for all generic library and program modules.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMMON (NAME, [MORE-OPTIONS])
     Like 'KPSE_BASIC' but add:
        'LT_PREREQ([2.2.6])'
        'LT_INIT([win32-dll])'
        'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'
        'AC_FUNC_FSEEKO'
     and check for frequently used functions, headers, types, and
     structures.  This is used for TeX-specific modules.

Macros for program checks:

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_LATEX
     Set 'LATEX' to the name of the first of 'latex', 'elatex', or
     'lambda' which exists in 'PATH', or to 'no' if none of them exists.
     Call 'AC_SUBST' for 'LATEX'.  The result of this test can be
     overridden by setting the 'LATEX' environment variable or the cache
     variable 'ac_cv_prog_LATEX'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_PDFLATEX
     Check for 'pdflatex' in 'PATH' and set 'PDFLATEX'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_PERL
     Check for 'perl' or 'perl5' in 'PATH' and set 'PERL'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_PROG_LEX
     Call 'AC_PROG_LEX' and add the flag '-l' for 'flex'.

6.3.3 Macros for compilers
--------------------------

Macros for compiler-related checks:

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMPILER_WARNINGS
     When using the (Objective) C/C++ compiler, set
     'WARNING_[OBJ]C[XX']FLAGS to suitable warning flags (depending on
     the value given to or implied for '--enable-compiler-warnings').
     Call 'AC_SUBST' for them.  At the moment this only works for GNU
     compilers, but could be extended to others if necessary.

     This macro caches its results in the 'kpse_cv_warning_cflags', ...
     variables.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMPILER_VISIBILITY
     When using the C or C++ compiler, try to set
     'VISIBILITY_C[XX]FLAGS' to flags to hide external symbols.  Call
     'AC_SUBST' for this variable.  At the moment this only tests for
     the compiler option '-fvisibility=hidden', but that could be
     extended with more checks if necessary.

     This macro caches its results in the 'kpse_cv_visibility_cflags' or
     'kpse_cv_visibility_cxxflags' variable.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CXX_HACK
     Provide the configure option '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack'.  If
     enabled and when using 'g++', try to statically link with
     'libstdc++', somewhat improving portability of the resulting
     binary.

     This macro caches its result in the 'kpse_cv_cxx_hack' variable.

6.3.4 Macros for libraries
--------------------------

One macro for a library check:

 -- Macro: KPSE_LARGEFILE (VARIABLE, [EXTRA-DEFINE])
     Call 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' and 'AC_FUNC_FSEEKO' and append suitable
     '-D' flags (optionally including '-DEXTRA-DEFINE') to VARIABLE.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for library and header flags,  Next: Macros for Windows,  Prev: Macros for libraries,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.5 Macros for library and header flags
-----------------------------------------

Each library module 'libs/LIB' or 'texk/LIB' is supplemented by a macro
'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' (all uppercase) that provides make variables for that
library.  E.g., for 'libs/libpng':

 -- Macro: KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS
     Provide the configure option '--with-system-libpng'.  Set and
     'AC_SUBST' 'make' variables for modules using this library (either
     an installed version or from the TeX Live tree): 'LIBPNG_INCLUDES'
     for use in CPPFLAGS, LIBPNG_LIBS for use in LDADD, LIBPNG_DEPEND
     for use as dependency, and LIBPNG_RULE defining 'make' rules to
     rebuild the library.

 -- Macro: KPSE_ADD_FLAGS (LIBNAME)
     Temporarily extend CPPFLAGS and LIBS with the values required for
     the library module 'NAME'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_RESTORE_FLAGS
     Restore 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LIBS' to their original values.

   As an example, the 'configure.ac' file for a hypothetical program
'utils/foo' using 'libpng', and hence 'zlib', would contain
     KPSE_ZLIB_FLAGS
     KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS

and its 'Makefile.am' would be along these lines:
     bin_PROGRAMS = foo
     AM_CPPFLAGS = ${ZLIB_INCLUDES} ${LIBPNG_INCLUDES}
     foo_LDADD = ${ZLIB_LIBS} ${LIBPNG_LIBS}
     foo_DEPENDENCIES = ${ZLIB_DEPEND} ${LIBPNG_DEPEND}
     ## Rebuild libz
     @ZLIB_RULE@
     ## Rebuild libpng
     @LIBPNG_RULE@

   If it was necessary to examine whether certain 'zlib' or 'libpng'
features were available, 'configure.ac' should be continued this way:
     KPSE_ADD_FLAGS([zlib])
     ... # tests for 'zlib' features, if any
     KPSE_ADD_FLAGS([libpng])
     ... # tests for 'libpng' features
     KPSE_RESTORE_FLAGS # restore 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LIBS'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for Windows,  Prev: Macros for library and header flags,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.6 Macros for Windows
------------------------

Windows differs in several aspects from Unix-like systems, many of them
due to the lack of symbolic links.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_WIN32
     Check if compiling for a Windows system.  The result is 'no' for
     Unix-like systems (including Cygwin), 'mingw32' for Windows with
     GCC, or 'native' for Windows with MSVC. The result is cached in the
     'kpse_cv_have_win32' variable.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_WIN32
     Call 'KPSE_CHECK_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional 'WIN32'
     ('true' if the value of 'kpse_cv_have_win32' is not 'no').

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_MINGW32
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional
     'MINGW32' ('true' if the value of 'kpse_cv_have_win32' is
     'mingw32').

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_WIN32_WRAP
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional
     'WIN32_WRAP' ('true' if the standard Windows wrapper
     ('texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/runscript.exe') exists.  This wrapper is
     used on Windows instead of symlinks for the "linked scripts" (*note
     Linked scripts::).

 -- Macro: KPSE_WIN32_CALL
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32', check if the file
     'texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/callexe.c' exists; if it does, create a
     symlink in the build tree.  Compiling 'callexe.c' with
     '-DEXEPROG='"FOO.exe"'' and installing 'callexe.exe' as 'BAR.exe'
     is used on Windows instead of a symlink 'BAR->FOO' for Unix-like
     systems.

6.4 Library modules
===================

Here we discuss some specifics for a few of the libraries in TL, both
for the details themselves, and as a way of illuminating the general
structure and variation.

* Menu:

* 'png' library::       'libs/libpng'
* 'zlib' library::      'libs/zlib'
* 'freetype' library::  'libs/freetype2'
* 'kpathsea' library::  'texk/kpathsea'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'png' library,  Next: 'zlib' library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.1 The 'png' library in 'libs/libpng'
----------------------------------------

This generic library uses the source tree in, e.g., the subdirectory
'libpng-1.5.17' with all modifications for TL recorded in
'libpng-1.5.17-PATCHES/*'.  The 'configure.ac' fragment
'ac/withenable.ac' contains

     KPSE_WITH_LIB([libpng], [zlib])

specifying the module name, and indicating the dependency on 'zlib'.  A
third literal argument 'tree' would specify that the library from the
TeX Live tree cannot be replaced by a system version.  That not being
the case here, a second fragment 'ac/libpng.ac' contains

     KPSE_TRY_LIB([libpng],
                  [#include <png.h>],
                  [png_structp png; png_voidp io; png_rw_ptr fn;
     png_set_read_fn(png, io, fn);])

thus providing the simple C code

     #include <png.h>
     int main ()
     { png_structp png; png_voidp io; png_rw_ptr fn;
       png_set_read_fn(png, io, fn);
       return 0; }

which Autoconf uses to verify the usability of a system version with C
code.  The analogous macro 'KPSE_TRY_LIBXX' would check using C++ code.
These fragments are included by 'configure.ac' at the top level.

   For this library, among many other modules, a proxy build system for
TL is used ('configure.ac', 'Makefile.am', and 'include/Makefile.am'),
ignoring the distributed one.  Consequently, a few generated files and
auxiliary scripts are removed from the distributed source tree.  The
public headers 'png.h', 'pngconf.h', and 'pnglibconf.h' are "installed"
(as symlinks) under 'include/' in the build tree exactly as they are for
a system version under, e.g., '/usr/include/'.

   The module is supplemented by the file 'm4/kpse-libpng-flags.m4' that
defines the M4 macro 'KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS' used by all modules depending
on this library in their 'configure.ac' to generate the 'make' variables
'LIBPNG_INCLUDES' for use in 'CPPFLAGS', 'LIBPNG_LIBS' for use in
'LDADD', 'LIBPNG_DEPEND' for use as dependencies, and 'LIBPNG_RULE'
defining 'make' rules to rebuild the library.

   'm4/kpse-libpng-flags.m4' also supplies the configure option
'--with-system-libpng' and uses 'pkg-config' to determine the flags
required for the system library.

6.4.2 The 'zlib' library in 'libs/zlib'
---------------------------------------

This generic library is very much analogous to 'libpng', but without the
dependency on any other library.  The file 'm4/kpse-zlib-flags.m4'
supplies the configure option '--with-system-zlib', as well as
'--with-zlib-includes' and '--with-zlib-libdir' to specify non-standard
locations of the 'zlib' headers and/or library.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'freetype' library,  Next: 'kpathsea' library,  Prev: 'zlib' library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.3 The 'freetype' library in 'libs/freetype2'
------------------------------------------------

This module uses a wrapper build system with an almost trivial
'configure.ac' and with a 'Makefile.am' that invokes 'configure' and
'make' for the distributed source, followed by 'make install' with the
build tree as destination.  The flags required for the system library
are obtained through 'freetype-config'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'kpathsea' library,  Prev: 'freetype' library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.4 The 'kpathsea' library in 'texk/kpathsea'
-----------------------------------------------

This is one of the TeX-specific libraries that are maintained as part of
TeX Live (*note (kpathsea)::).  Despite being a core part of the TeX
system, it is not a terribly special case in the infrastructure.  The
TeX libraries are Libtool libraries (static and/or shared) and are
installed by 'make install' together with the programs.  They are,
however, not part of the TL DVD as distributed by TeX user groups, and
have never been officially released for standalone use.

   It is possible, and possibly even useful for distro builds (*note
Distro builds::, to specify the configure option
'--with-system-kpathsea' in order to use a system version of the library
and it may then be necessary to specify '--with-kpathsea-includes'
and/or '--with-kpathsea-libdir'.

   In addition to 'ac/withenable.ac' and 'ac/kpathsea.ac' there is a
third fragment 'ac/mktex.ac' included by both 'ac/withenable.ac' and
'configure.ac' that supplies configure options such as
'--enable-mktextfm-default', which determine the compile time default of
whether or not to run 'mktextfm' to generate a missing '.tfm' file.  In
any case, however, the command line options '-mktex=tfm' or
'-no-mktex=tfm' for the TeX-like engines override this default.

6.5 Program modules
===================

As with libraries (*note Library modules::), here we discuss the details
for a few of the programs in TL.

* Menu:

* 't1utils' package:: 'utils/t1utils'
* 'xindy' package::   'utils/xindy'
* 'xdvik' package::   'texk/xdvik'
* 'asymptote'::       'utils/asymptote'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 't1utils' package,  Next: 'xindy' package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.1 The 't1utils' package in 'utils/t1utils'
----------------------------------------------

Once again we use the distributed source tree 't1utils-1.38' with
modifications documented in 't1utils-1.38-PATCHES/*' and a proxy build
system consisting of 'configure.ac' and 'Makefile.am'.  The fragment
'ac/withenable.ac' contains

     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([t1utils])

specifying the module name without any dependencies, and supplies the
configure option '--disable-t1utils'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'xindy' package,  Next: 'xdvik' package,  Prev: 't1utils' package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.2 The 'xindy' package in 'utils/xindy'
------------------------------------------

This module uses the distributed source tree 'xindy-2.4' with
modifications documented in 'xindy-2.4-PATCHES/*', a proxy
'configure.ac', and a wrapper 'Makefile.am' that descends into
'xindy-2.4'.  The 'xindy' build requires that the distributed
'Makefile's allow a 'VPATH' build, can handle all targets, and do not
refer to '${top_srcdir}' or '${top_builddir}'.  The fragment
'ac/withenable.ac' contains

     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([xindy], , [disable native])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[utils/xindy/ac/xindy.ac])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[utils/xindy/ac/clisp.ac])

where 'disable' in the third argument indicates that 'xindy' is only
built if explicitly enabled by the user with 'configure --enable-xindy'
(the need for 'clisp' is too painful to require by default), and
'native' disallows cross compilation.  The additional fragments
'ac/xindy.ac' and 'ac/clisp.ac' specify more 'configure' options to be
seen at the top level with 'ac/xindy.ac' also included by
'configure.ac'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'xdvik' package,  Next: 'asymptote',  Prev: 'xindy' package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.3 The 'xdvik' package in 'texk/xdvik'
-----------------------------------------

This package is maintained as part of the TeX Live tree with sources in
its top level directory and the subdirectory 'gui'.  The fragment
'ac/withenable.ac' contains

     dnl extra_dirs = texk/xdvik/squeeze
     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([xdvik], [kpathsea freetype2], [x])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[texk/xdvik/ac/xdvik.ac])

thus specifying the dependency on the 'kpathsea', 'freetype', and X11
libraries.  The M4 comment (following 'dnl') signals the subsidiary
'squeeze/configure.ac'.  This is needed because the main executable
'xdvi-bin' (to be installed as, e.g., 'xdvi-xaw') is for the 'host'
system whereas the auxiliary program 'squeeze/squeeze' has to run on the
'build' system and in a cross compilation they differ.

   The additional fragment 'ac/xdvik.ac' is also included by
'configure.ac' and supplies the configure option '--with-xdvi-x-toolkit'
also seen at the top-level.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: 'asymptote',  Prev: 'xdvik' package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.4 The subdirectory 'utils/asymptote'
----------------------------------------

This subdirectory contains the sources for 'asy' and 'xasy' but due to
its complexity and prerequisites (e.g., OpenGL) it is not part of the TL
build system.  These programs must be built and installed independently,
but are included on the TL DVD together with their support files.

6.6 Extending TeX Live
======================

This section outlines the basic process for adding new packages to the
TL build system.

* Menu:

* Adding a new program module::
* Adding a new generic library module::
* Adding a new TeX-specific library module::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Adding a new program module,  Next: Adding a new generic library module,  Up: Extending TeX Live

6.6.1 Adding a new program module
---------------------------------

A TeX-specific program module in a subdirectory 'texk/PROG' may use the
TeX-specific libraries and is included by adding its name 'PROG' to the
M4 list 'kpse_texk_pkgs' defined in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   A generic program module in a subdirectory 'utils/PROG' must not use
the TeX-specific libraries and is included by adding its name 'PROG' to
the M4 list 'kpse_utils_pkgs' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   In either case, apart from the program sources and build system
('configure.ac' and 'Makefile.am'), the subdirectory 'texk/PROG' or
'utils/PROG' must provide a fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' that contains
the M4 macro 'KPSE_ENABLE_PROG' defined in 'm4/kpse-setup.m4' with
'PROG' as the mandatory first argument and three optional arguments:

  1. a list of required libraries from the TL tree;

  2. a list of options ('disable' if this module is not to be built
     without the configure option '--enable-PROG', 'native' if cross
     compilation is not possible, 'x' if the program requires X11
     libraries);

  3. and a comment added to the help text for the 'configure' option
     '--enable-PROG' or '--disable-PROG'.

   If the module requires specific configure options to be seen at the
top-level, they should be defined in an additional fragment 'ac/PROG.ac'
included from 'ac/withenable.ac' and 'configure.ac'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Adding a new generic library module,  Next: Adding a new TeX-specific library module,  Prev: Adding a new program module,  Up: Extending TeX Live

6.6.2 Adding a new generic library module
-----------------------------------------

A generic library module in a subdirectory 'libs/LIB' must not depend on
TeX-specific libraries, by definition.  It is included by adding its
name 'LIB' to the M4 list 'kpse_libs_pkgs' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'--before
any other libraries from the TeX Live tree on which it depends.

   As with program modules, the subdirectory 'libs/LIB' must contain the
sources and build system for the library (and any installable support
programs) and a fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' that contains the M4 macro
'KPSE_WITH_LIB' defined in 'm4/kpse-setup.m4' with 'LIB' as the
mandatory first argument and two optional arguments: a list of required
libraries from the TL tree, and a list of options (currently there is
only one: specify 'tree' if this library cannot be replaced by a system
version).

   If a system version can be used, a second fragment 'ac/LIB.ac' is
needed, containing the M4 macro 'KPSE_TRY_LIB' (or 'KPSE_TRY_LIBXX')
with 'LIB' as the mandatory first argument and two additional arguments
for the Autoconf macro 'AC_LANG_PROGRAM' used to compile and link a
small C (or C++) program as sanity check for using the system library.

   In addition a file 'm4/kpse-LIB-flags' (at the top level) must define
the M4 macro 'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' (all uppercase) setting up the 'make'
variables 'LIB_INCLUDES', 'LIB_LIBS', 'LIB_DEPEND', and 'LIB_RULE' with
the values required for 'CPPFLAGS', 'LDADD', dependencies, and a
(multi-line) 'make' rule to rebuild the library when necessary.  All of
that is needed for the library from the TL tree and, if supported, for a
system version.

   If a system library is allowed, 'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' also provides the
configure option '--with-system-LIB' and uses the additional M4 macro
'KPSE_LIB_SYSTEM_FLAGS' to generate the 'make' variables for a system
library.  Furthermore the definition of the M4 macro
'KPSE_ALL_SYSTEM_FLAGS' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4' must be extended by the
line:
   'AC_REQUIRE([KPSE_LIB_SYSTEM_FLAGS])'

6.6.3 Adding a new TeX-specific library module
----------------------------------------------

A TeX-specific library module in a subdirectory 'texk/LIB' may depend on
other TeX-specific libraries but must not depend on any generic library
from the TL tree.  It is included in the same general ways as a generic
library (see the previous section), with these modifications:

   * The library name 'LIB' is added to the M4 list 'kpse_texlibs_pkgs'
     also in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   * The fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' must use 'KPSE_WITH_TEXLIB'.

7 Configure options
*******************

Corresponding to the large number of program and library modules there
are a large number 'configure' options, most of which are described
here.  The command
   'configure --help'
at the top level gives an exhaustive list of all global options and a
few important module-specific ones, whereas, e.g.,
   'texk/lcdf-typetools/configure --help'
also displays the 'lcdf-typetools' specific options, which are not shown
by the top-level '--help'.

   The help text also mentions several influential environment
variables, but for TeX Live it is better to specify them as assigments
on the command line.

   The './Build' script used to make the binaries shipped with TeX Live
invokes the top-level 'configure' with a few additional options (*note
Building::).  The defaults discussed below are those for the actual
'configure' script; invoking 'configure' via './Build' may yield
different results.

   Defaults for most options are set at the top level and propagated
explicitly to all subdirectories.  Options specified on the command line
are checked for consistency but never modified.

Here are the global configure options.

* '--disable-native-texlive-build'::
* '--prefix' '--bindir' ...::
* '--disable-largefile'::
* '--disable-missing'::
* '--enable-compiler-warnings='LEVEL::
* '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack'::

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--disable-native-texlive-build',  Next: '--prefix' '--bindir' ...,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.1 '--disable-native-texlive-build'
--------------------------------------

If enabled (the default), build for a TL binary distribution as shipped
by the TeX user groups.  This requires GNU 'make' and implies
'--enable-multiplatform' and '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack' (unless they
are explicitly disabled), and enforces '--disable-shared'.

   If building TL for a GNU/Linux or other distribution, this should be
disabled and system versions of most libraries would be used (*note
Distro builds::).  This may fail without GNU 'make', but will be tried
regardless.

   A related option, '--enable-texlive-build', is automatically passed
to all subdirectories (and cannot be disabled).  Subdirectories that can
also be built independently from the TL tree (such as 'utils/xindy' and
'texk/dvipng') can use this option, e.g., to choose TL-specific
installation paths.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--prefix' '--bindir' ...,  Next: '--disable-largefile',  Prev: '--disable-native-texlive-build',  Up: Global configure options

7.1.2 '--prefix', '--bindir', ...
---------------------------------

These standard Autoconf options specify various installation directories
as usual.  For the complete list, *note Installation directories::.

   Also as usual, all values are prefixed by the value of 'DESTDIR', if
set, on the 'make' command line (*note Installation in a temporary
location: (automake)Staged Installs.).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--disable-largefile',  Next: '--disable-missing',  Prev: '--prefix' '--bindir' ...,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.3 '--disable-largefile'
---------------------------

Omit large file support (LFS), needed on most 32-bit Unix systems for
files with 2GB or more.  Regardless of this, the size of 'DVI' and 'GF'
files must always be <2GB, due to the file format specifications.

   With LFS, there is no fixed limit on the size of PDF files created by
'pdftex' or PostScript files created by 'dvips'.  The size of PDF images
included by 'pdftex' must, however, be <4GB when using 'xpdf' and <2GB
when using older versions of 'poppler' (even on 64-bit systems with
LFS), whereas 'poppler' versions 0.23 and later impose no such limit.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--disable-missing',  Next: '--enable-compiler-warnings='LEVEL,  Prev: '--disable-largefile',  Up: Global configure options

7.1.4 '--disable-missing'
-------------------------

Immediately terminate the build process if a requested program or
feature must be disabled, e.g., due to missing libraries.  This can help
when figuring out a specific (sub)set of modules to enable.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--enable-compiler-warnings='LEVEL,  Next: '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack',  Prev: '--disable-missing',  Up: Global configure options

7.1.5 '--enable-compiler-warnings='LEVEL
----------------------------------------

Enable various levels of compiler warnings for (Objective) C and C++:
the LEVEL value can be one of: 'no min yes max all'.  The default is
'yes' in 'maintainer-mode' (see below) and 'min' otherwise.  This option
defines 'WARNING_[OBJ]C[XX]FLAGS' but these flags are not used in all
library and program modules.  Using them should help to resolve
portability problems.

   At present, these warning flags are only defined for the GNU
compilers but flags for other compilers could be added when needed.

7.1.6 '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack'
---------------------------------

If enabled (as it is for the native TL build) and when using 'g++', try

7.1.7 '--enable-maintainer-mode'
--------------------------------

Enable 'make' rules and dependencies not useful (and sometimes
confusing) to the casual user.  This requires current versions of the
GNU build tools (*note Build system tools::), as it automatically
rebuilds infrastructure files as needed.  *Note 'missing' and
'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE': (automake)maintainer-mode.

------------------------------

If enabled, install executables and libraries in per-platform
subdirectories of 'EPREFIX/bin' and 'EPREFIX/lib' where EPREFIX is the
value given or implied for 'exec_prefix'.  This can be overridden by
explicitly '--bindir=DIR' or '--libdir=DIR'.  In any case, the values
for 'bindir' and 'libdir' are automatically propagated to all
subdirectories.

'libkpathsea'.  This is not allowed for a native TL build (i.e.,
'--disable-native-texlive-build' must also be specified).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: '--enable-silent-rules',  Next: '--without-ln-s',  Prev: '--enable-shared',  Up: Global configure options

7.1.10 '--enable-silent-rules'
------------------------------

Enable the use of less verbose build rules.  When using GNU 'make' (or
another 'make' implementation supporting nested variable expansions),
you can specify 'V=1' on the 'make' command line to get more verbosity,
or 'V=0' to get less, regardless of this option.

7.2.2 '--disable-all-pkgs'
--------------------------

Do not build any program modules by default--only those explicitly
enabled.  This is useful when one wants to work on only a single
program, which is specified with an additional '--enable' option, e.g.,
'--enable-dvipdfm-x'.  It's still simplest to check out and configure
the whole source tree, but at least only the program you are interested
in, and its dependencies, are built.  The 'configure' will generally
take less than a minute with everything disabled.  (It is a good idea to
run 'make check' after doing this, and after making any changes, to
ensure that whatever tests have been written still pass.)

   Without this option, all modules are built except those that are
explicitly disabled or specify 'disable' in their 'ac/withenable.ac'
fragment.

7.2.3 Configure options for 'texk/web2c'
----------------------------------------

'--with-banner-add=STR'
Add 'STR' to the default version string ('TeX Live YEAR' or 'Web2C
YEAR') appended to banner lines.  This is ignored for a native TL build,
but distro builds should specify, e.g., '/SOMEDISTRO'.

'--with-editor=CMD'
Specify the command 'CMD' to invoke from the 'e' option of TeX-like
engines, replacing the default 'vi +%d '%s'' for Unix or 'texworks
--position=%d "%s"' for Windows.

'--with-fontconfig-includes=DIR', '--with-fontconfig-libdir=DIR'
Building XeTeX on non-Mac systems requires the 'fontconfig' library
headers and code.  If one or both of these options are given, the
required flags are derived from them; otherwise, they are determined via
'pkg-config' (if present).

'--with-mf-x-toolkit'
Use the X toolkit ('libXt') for Metafont (the default is to use the
lowest-level 'Xlib' support; it seems this has the best chance of
working across X installations nowadays).

'--disable-dump-share'
Make the 'fmt'/'base' dump files architecture dependent (somewhat faster
on LittleEndian architectures).

'--disable-ipc'
Disable TeX's '--ipc' option.

'--disable-mf-nowin'
Do not build a separate non-graphically-capable Metafont ('mf-nowin').

'--disable-omfonts'
Build the WEB versions of the Omega font utilities 'ofm2opl', 'opl2ofm',
'ovf2ovp', and 'ovp2ovf' instead of the C version 'omfonts'.  The WEB
and C versions should be roughly equivalent.

'--disable-tex', '--enable-etex', ...
Do not or do build the various TeX, Metafont, and MetaPost engines
(defaults are defined in the fragment 'texk/web2c/ac/web2c.ac').

'--disable-web-progs'
Do not build the core WEB programs 'bibtex', ..., 'weave'.  Useful if,
e.g., you only want to (re)build some engines.

'--enable-auto-core'
This option causes TeX and Metafont to produce a core dump when a
particular hacky filename is encountered, for use in creating preloaded
binaries.  This is rarely done nowadays.

'--enable-libtool-hack'
If enabled (which is the default for all platforms), prevents 'libtool'
from linking explicitly with dependencies of 'libfontconfig' such as
'libexpat'.

'--enable-*win'
Include various types of other window support for Metafont (EPSF output,
'mftalk', old terminals, ...).

'--enable-tex-synctex', '--disable-etex-synctex', ...
Build the TeX engines with or without 'SyncTeX' support; ignored for a
native TeX Live build, defaults are again defined in
'texk/web2c/ac/web2c.ac'.

The former modules 'dvipdfmx' (extended DVI to PDF converter) and
'xdvipdfmx' (the same, as used by XeTeX) have been merged into
'dvipdfm-x' at the source level.  Two separate binaries are still
created by default.  In addition, 'dvipdfm' is created as a symlink to
'dvipdfmx', with backward-compatible (very slightly different) behavior.

'--disable-dvipdfmx'
Do not build the 'dvipdfmx' program or create the 'dvipdfm' symlink.

'--disable-xdvipdfmx'
Do not build the 'xdvipdfmx' program (building 'xdvipdfmx' requires the
'freetype' library).

(not allowed for a native TL build).  The default is to load the 'gs'
library at runtime if possible, or otherwise disable support for
PostScript specials.

'--without-libgs'
Build 'dvisvgm' without PostScript support at all.  Because the dynamic
loading just mention defeats all attempts at static linking, the result
can crash due to library incompatibilities, e.g., on CentOS 5.

'--with-libgs-includes=DIR', '--with-libgs-libdir=DIR'

build).

'--enable-xindy-docs'
Build and install 'xindy' documentation (default: yes, except for a
native TL build).

'--with-clisp-runtime=FILENAME'
Specifies the Full path for the CLISP runtime file ('lisp.run' or
'lisp.exe') to be installed.  When specified as 'default' (the default
for a native TL build) the path is determined by the CLISP executable;
the value 'system' (not allowed for a native TL build, but the default
for a non-native one) indicates that 'xindy' will use the installed
version of 'clisp' (which must be identical to the one used to build
'xindy').

'--with-recode'

broken.

Here are (some of) the library-specific 'configure' options, starting
with this generic one:

'--with-system-LIB'

   Use an installed (system) version of the library 'LIB'; this option
exists for most libraries, but is not allowed for a native TL build.
Using a system version implies also using the system versions of all
libraries (if any) that LIB depends on.

   For many libraries '--with-LIB-includes=DIR' and
'--with-LIB-libdir=DIR' to specify non-standard search locations; others
use 'pkg-config' or similar to determine the required flags.

   The top-level 'configure' script performs a consistency check for all
required system libraries and bails out if tests fail.

--------------------------------------------

Building LuaTeX and XeTeX requires 'poppler', either from the TL tree or
system headers and library.  Building pdfTeX requires either 'xpdf' from
the TeX Live tree or system 'poppler' headers and library.

'--with-system-poppler'
Use a system version (0.18 or newer) of 'poppler' for LuaTeX and XeTeX,
and use 'pkg-config' to obtain the required flags.

'--with-system-xpdf'
Use a system version (0.12 or better) of 'poppler' (and 'pkg-config')
for pdfTeX instead of 'xpdf' from the TL tree.  *Note
'--disable-largefile'::.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Variables for configure,  Prev: Library-specific configure options,  Up: Configure options

7.4 Variables for configure
===========================

The values for these variables can be specified as 'configure' arguments
of the form 'VAR=VALUE'.  They can also be defined in the environment,
but that might not work for cross compilations.

'CC'
'CXX'
'CPPFLAGS'
     And plenty more.  As usual with Autoconf, these variables specify
     the name (or full path) of compilers, preprocessor flags, and
     similar.  *Note autoconf: (GNU Autoconf)Preset Output Variables.

'CLISP'
     Name (or full path) of the 'clisp' executable, used to build
     'xindy'.

'FT2_CONFIG'
'ICU_CONFIG'
'PKG_CONFIG'
     These specify the name (or path) for the 'freetype-config',
     'icu-config', and 'pkg-config' commands used to determine the flags
     required for system versions of 'libfreetype', the ICU libraries,
     or many other libraries.

'KPSEWHICH'
     Name (or path) of an installed 'kpsewhich' binary, used by 'make
     check' to determine the location of, e.g., 'cmbx10.tfm'.

'MAKE'
'SED'
     And more.  Name (or path) of the 'make', 'sed', and similar
     programs; used at the top level and propagated to all
     subdirectories.

'PERL'
'LATEX'
'PDFLATEX'
     Name (or full path) for the 'perl', 'latex', and 'pdflatex'
     commands used, e.g., to build the 'xindy' documentation.

'TL_PLATFORM'
     The utility program 'biber' consists of many Perl modules bundled
     into an executable by the 'Par::Packer' mechanism.  Therefore it is
     not feasible to build 'biber' as part of TL.

     However, in order for 'make install' to create all executables in
     'bindir', the 'biber' module in TL contains pre-made binaries (by
     'biber' contributors, released on the original 'biber' site) for
     the platforms for which they are available.  TL merely checks if an
     executable is present for the current platform, and if so, installs
     it.

     The complication is hidden in the phrase "current platform".  TL
     has its own ideas about platform names, and the mapping from the
     canonical system name determined by 'config.guess' or 'config.sub'
     to the TL platform name is not trivial.  So, a value given for
     'TL_PLATFORM' is used as the TL platform name.  Otherwise, the
     build uses copies of the Perl modules 'TeXLive/TLUtils.pm' and
     'TeXLive/TLConfig.pm', to avoid duplicating the platform-detection
     logic.

8 Cross compilation
*******************

In a cross compilation a "build" system is used to create binaries to be
executed on a "host" system with different hardware and/or operating
system.

   In simple cases, the build system can execute binaries for the host
system.  This typically occurs for bi-arch systems where, e.g.,
'i386-linux' binaries can run on 'x86_64-linux' systems and 'win32'
binaries can run on 'win64' systems.  Although sometimes called "native
cross", technically this is not cross compilation at all.  In most such
cases it suffices to specify suitable compiler flags.  It might be
useful to add the configure option '--build=HOST' to get the correct
canonical host name, but note that this should _not_ be '--host=HOST'
(*note (autoconf)Hosts and Cross-Compilation::).

   In order to build, e.g., 32-bit binaries with 'clang' on a 64-bit OSX
system one could use
   './Build --build=i386-apple-darwin CC='clang -arch i386'' \
         'CXX='clang++ -arch i386' OBJCXX='clang++ -arch i386''

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Cross configuring,  Next: Cross problems,  Up: Cross compilation

8.1 Cross configuring
=====================

In a standard cross compilation, binaries for the host system cannot
execute on the build system and it is necessary to specify the configure
options '--host=HOST' and '--build=BUILD' with two different values.

   Building binaries requires suitable "cross" tools, e.g., compiler,
linker, and archiver, and perhaps a "cross" version of 'pkg-config' and
similar to locate host system libraries.  Autoconf expects that these
cross tools are given by their usual variables or found under their
usual name prefixed with 'HOST-'.  Here a list of such tools and
corresponding variables:

     ar                AR
     freetype-config   FT2_CONFIG
     g++               CXX
     gcc               CC
     icu-config        ICU_CONFIG
     objdump           OBJDUMP
     pkg-config        PKG_CONFIG
     ranlib            RANLIB
     strip             STRIP

In order to, e.g., build 'mingw32' binaries on 'x86_64-linux' with a
cross compiler found as 'i386-pc-mingw32-gcc' one would specify

     --host=i386-pc-mingw32 --build=x86_64-linux-gnu

or perhaps

     --host=mingw32 --build=x86_64-linux CC=i386-pc-mingw32-gcc

but this latter, especially, might require adding 'CXX' and others.

   Configure arguments such as 'CFLAGS=...' refer to the cross compiler.
If necessary, you can specify compilers and flags for the few auxiliary
C and C++ programs required for the build process as configure arguments

     BUILDCC=...
     BUILDCPPFLAGS=...
     BUILDCFLAGS=...
     BUILDCXX=...
     BUILDCXXFLAGS=...
     BUILDLDFLAGS=...


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Cross problems,  Prev: Cross configuring,  Up: Cross compilation

8.2 Cross problems
==================

The fact that binaries for the host system cannot be executed on the
build system causes some problems.

   One problem is that configure tests using 'AC_RUN_IFELSE' can compile
and link the test program but cannot execute it.  Such tests should be
avoided if possible and otherwise must supply a pessimistic test result.

   Another problem arises if the build process must execute some
(auxiliary or installable) programs.  Auxiliary programs can be placed
into a subdirectory that is configured natively as is done for
'texk/web2c/web2c', 'texk/dvipsk/squeeze', and 'texk/xdvik/squeeze'.
The module 'libs/freetype2' uses the value of 'CC_BUILD', 'BUILD-gcc',
'gcc', or 'cc' as compiler for the auxiliary program.

   Building LuaTeX (or LuaJITTeX) uses the auxiliary program 'txt2zlib'
to create 'pdflua.c' and, if necessary, update the distributed version
of that file.  In a cross compilation we simply use that distributed
file.

   The situation for installable programs needed by the build process is
somewhat different.  A quite expensive possibility, chosen for the ICU
libraries in module 'libs/icu', is to first compile natively for the
build system and in a second step to use these (uninstalled) programs
during the cross compilation.

   This approach would also be possible for the tools such as 'tangle'
used in the module 'texk/web2c' to build the WEB programs, but that
would require first building a native 'kpathsea' library.  To avoid this
complication, cross compilation of the WEB or CWEB programs requires
sufficiently recent installed versions of 'tangle', 'ctangle',
'otangle', and 'tie'.

   Building 'xindy' requires running the host system 'clisp' binary,
thus cross compilation is not possible.

9 Coding conventions
********************

Ideally, building all of TeX Live with '--enable-compiler-warnings=max'
should produce no (GCC) compiler warnings at all.  In spite of
considerable efforts into that direction we are still far from that goal
and there are reasons that we may never fully reach it.  Below are some
rules about declarations of functions or variables and the use of
'const'.  These rules should be applied to all parts of the TeX Live
tree, except some of those maintained independently.

* Menu:

* Declarations and definitions::
* Const::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Declarations and definitions,  Next: Const,  Up: Coding conventions

9.1 Declarations and definitions
================================

C standards
...........

The TeX Live build system no longer supports pre-ANSI C compilers.  Thus
all function prototypes and definitions must conform to the ANSI C
standard (including 'void' in the declaration of C functions with no
parameters).  On the other hand, TL is built for a wide variety of
systems, not all of which support the C99 standard.  Therefore using C99
features should be avoided if that can easily be done.  In particular C
code must not contain declarations after statements or C++-style
comments.

   If some C99 (or later) constructs must be used, the module should
verify that they are available and otherwise provide an alternative.
For example, the module 'texk/chktex' uses the C99 function 'stpcpy()'
that may or may not be available on a particular system.  It uses
'AC_CHECK_DECLS([stpcpy])' in 'configure.ac' to test this, and provides
the perhaps slightly less efficient alternative

     #if !(defined HAVE_DECL_STPCPY && HAVE_DECL_STPCPY)
     #static inline char *stpcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
     {
       return strcpy(dest, src) + strlen(src);
     }
     #endif

in the file 'Utility.h'.

Static functions
................

Functions used in only one file should be declared 'static'; they
require no prototype except as forward declaration.

Extern functions
................

Functions not declared 'static', usually because they are used in
several files, require an ('extern') prototype in exactly one header
file, which is included in the file defining the function and in all
files using that function--this is the only way to guarantee consistency
between definition and use.  There should be no 'extern' declarations
sprinkled throughout the C code (with or without comments as to where
that function is defined).

Variable declarations
.....................

The declaration of global variables follows analogous rules: they are
either declared 'static' if used in only one file or declared 'extern'
in exactly one header and instantiated in exactly one file.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Const,  Prev: Declarations and definitions,  Up: Coding conventions

9.2 Const
=========

The 'const' feature of C is valuable, but easy to mis-use.

Function parameters
...................

Ideally, a function parameter not modified by the function should be
declared as 'const'.  This is important in particular for strings
('char*') because the actual arguments are often string literals.  It is
perfectly legitimate and safe to use a type 'char*' value for a type
'const char*' variable (in an assignment, as initializer, as function
argument, or as return value).  It is equally safe to use a type
'char**' value for a type 'const char*const*' variable, but not for a
type 'const char**' variable since that might cause modification of a
quantity supposed to be constant.

   Getting all 'const' qualifiers right can get quite involved but can
almost always be done.  There are only a couple notable exceptions: the
X11 headers are full of declarations that ought to use 'const' but do
not, and the same is true to some extent for 'libfreetype' (but,
thankfully, not for 'zlib' nowadays).

What must be avoided with 'const'
.................................

The GCC compiler warnings "assignment discards qualifiers..." and
analogous warnings for "initialization", "passing arg", or "return" must
be strenously avoided in our own code.  The only exception is when they
are caused by X11 headers or macros or other third party code.

What should be avoided with 'const'
...................................

A type cast, e.g., from 'const char*' to 'char*' does not solve any
problems; depending on warning options, it may only hide them.
Therefore such casts should be avoided whenever possible and otherwise
must be carefully analyzed to make sure that they cannot cause the
modification of quantities supposed to be constant.
