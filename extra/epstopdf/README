The test-binary and test-bin2 files were supplied by Akira Kakuto and
Reinhard Kotucha.  They contain binary data.  They are public domain.

The test-binhdr* files were supplied by Martin von Gagern, constructed
as follows.  They contain binary junk before the EPS starts.  We also
use these to test different line endings.  These files are public domain.
