                 You can use this to ask \
                 questions that have an answer of either yes or no (or maybe). \
                 BTW, do you notice that long lines will be automatically \
                 wrapped around so that they can fit in the box? You can \
                 also control line breaking explicitly by inserting \
                 'backslash n' at any place you like, but in this case, \
                 auto wrap around will be disabled and you will have to \
                 control line breaking yourself." 15 61
