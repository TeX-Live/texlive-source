This directory utils/dummy does not build or install anything.  Its purpose
is to record the command line used to invoke utils/dummy/configure from
utils/configure.  This information is then used by utils/Makefile to invoke
utils/*/configure in the remaining subdirectories without the need to adjust
any absolute or relative paths.
