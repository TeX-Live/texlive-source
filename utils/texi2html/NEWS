This file records noteworthy changes.

1.76 (February  3 2005)

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

* Perl no longer needs to be installed at build time, but when it is not, the
  path to `perl' that will be used at run time must be passed to the
  `configure' script.

1.74 (January 31 2005)

* COMPATIBILITY
  -------------

* The argument on def like commands line (@deffn and friends) may be 
  bracketed, therefore there is no difference between this element and 
  others. There is no need of items with { in front in the %def_map
  anymore.

* NEW FEATURES
  ------------

* More @-commands are available to the user, that were ignored before.
  Most of these @-commands are those related with structure or printed 
  output.

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

* many deffn and friends line parsing bugs fixed.

1.72 (December 29 2004)

* NEW FEATURES
  ------------

* Handle texinfo 4.7 constructs:
  @caption, @shortcaption, @ordf, @ordm, @registeredsymbol, @deftypecv, 
  @LaTeX, @indicateurl, @docbook, @ifdocbook, @ifnotdocbook, @comma, 
  @headitem, @quotation second arg, @acronym second arg.
  @url is now a synonym for @uref. @ at the end of a @def* line continues the
  line.
  Handle texinfo 4.8 constructs:
  @abbr, @slanted, @euro and @sansserif.
* Cross refs are done according to the specification presented in the texinfo
  manual in the node HTML Xref.

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

* Re enable compatibility with perl older that 5.6.

1.70 (March 24 2004)

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

* use i18n files even when translations.pl is not included. Include
  translations.pl.

* COMPATIBILITY
  -------------

* install html manual in $datadir/texinfo/html.

* NEW FEATURES
  ------------

* Add a spec file, usefull to build a rpm.

* FOR DEVELOPERS
  --------------

* Standardized on Autoconf 2.59 & Automake 1.8.3

1.68 (March 20 2004)

* COMPATIBILITY
  -------------

* When the manual is split the default is to put resulting files in a 
  directory with name the manual file basename (previously they were left in
  the current directory). To avoid that, call texi2html with '-output .'.

*  The main configuration files are now ./Config, ~/.texi2html/Config, 
  $sysconfdir/texi2html/Config and last $datadir/texi2html/Config. They are 
  sourced in that order.
  In the future `/etc/texi2htmlrc' and `~/.texi2htmlrc' will no longer be 
  sourced and any existing site or user configuration should be moved to the 
  new locations if you wish it to be used by newer versions of Texi2HTML.

* Translation files are now stored in $datadir/texi2html/i18n/*, 
  $sysconfdir/texi2html/i18n/*, ~/.texi2html/i18n/*, and sourced in that order. 
  The translated strings are now associated with the english strings.
  Please see the documentation for the format of the new translation files.

* First index page is the first page with a non empty index (with @printindex).

* The glossary and bibliography terms aren't searched anymore. You should use 
  @macro to simulate these features (look at Tests/macros/glossary.texi for
  an example).

* We've standardized on GNU-style `--' prefixed long options, rather than the
  old single-dash prefixed long options in the help, but the single-dash style
  is still accepted on the command line for the time being. 
  We also changed `_' to `-' in option names.

* @setref handling is removed as the right corresponding @-command is @anchor.

* No more global variables outside of namespaces.
  Global variables are now in the Texi2HTML namespace.
  leading T2H_ is stripped from variable, hashes and array names. You should 
  change your variable names for the new release. As the global variables 
  (%THISDOC, $THIS_SECTION...) are in the Texi2HTML namespace you should use,
  for example, $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'fulltitle'} now.
  functions from the main program should now be qualified in the main
  namespace. t2h_ is stripped from the function names too.
  t2h_anchor is now a function reference in init file, and thus should 
  be called like &$anchor(...).
  toc file and main file are arguments for print_frame, overview lines are 
  arguments for print_toc_frame (instead of global variables).

* $THISPROG, $T2H_HOMEPAGE, $T2H_AUTHORS, $T2H_TODAY, $T2H_USER are now 
  values associated with the following keys in %Texi2HTML::THISDOC: 
  `program', `program_homepage', `today', `user'.

* Changes in the function reference used for the page layout: 
  print_section don't do the end of page or section anymore (except when 
  split at node), end_section does the end of a section, and print_*_footer 
  does the end of page.
  the print_*_header, print_*_footer... functions take a ref on the buttons
  array as argument, instead of using the $T2H_BUTTONS global variable.
  Have a look at the texi2html.init file to update your configuration files.

* T2H_InitGlobals is not used anymore. Use the function reference init_out 
  to define $BODYTEXT dynamically and %Texi2HTML::THISDOC values in 
  print_page_foot and about_body to recreate the address instead of the 
  $T2H_ADDRESS.
  You can have a look at program_string in texi2html.init which recreates 
  the address. $T2H_ADDRESS isn't used anymore.

* variables for latex2html are not in texi2html init file anymore but in 
  l2h.init.

* don't expand @ifinfo regions by default.

* option --output obsoletes -out_file and -subdir. It is the same than 
  --out_file when output is not split, and the same than --subdir when it is
  split.

* If not split, the resulting file has a leading directory, and the directory 
  doesn't exist, it is created.

* If a directory creation fails the program aborts.

* Don't use T2H_CENTER_IMAGE, @center should be used.

* the init_out function redefines dynamically %NAVIGATION_TEXT, %BUTTONS_GOTO
  and $BODYTEXT. You should redefine the hash values in that function. If you 
  want to reuse the values of the default values set by init_out,
  you could do something like:

  my $default_init_out = $init_out;
  $init_out = \&makeinfo_like_init_out;
  sub makeinfo_like_init_out() 
  {
     my $encoding = &$default_init_out();
     $NAVIGATION_TEXT{'Following'} = ' &gt; ';
     return $encoding;
  }

* NEW FEATURES
  ------------

* Many changes towards output of stricter HTML.

* initialization files for html 3.2, xhtml, html 4.0 with inline style,
  no header, utf8 characters outputted, makeinfo style, book style, conversion
  to chm files and conversion to roff. Initialization files are searched 
  in ./, ~/.texi2html, $sysconfdir/texi2html and last $datadir/texi2html. 
  The file names are html32.init, xhtml.init, inlinestyle.init, 
  noheaders.init, utf8.init, makeinfo.init, book.init, chm.init and roff.init.

* The test suite is much more comprehensive and uses validate and tidy to
  assess the correctness of the HTML.

* Handling of @html, @verbatim, @verb, @sp, @=, @copying, @insertcopying,
  @cartouche, @titlefont, @dircategory, @direntry, @shorttitlepage, @\,
  @afourlatex, @afourwide, @firstparagraphindent, @exampleindent, @novalidate,
  @definfoenclose, @kbdinputstyle, @centerchap, @documentdescription,
  @documentencoding, @contents, @shortcontents, @verbatiminclude.

* With --no-validate node cross-reference validation is suppressed (like
  @novalidate).

* --expand may be specified more than once such that more than one additional
  region could be expanded. --noexpand does the reverse. --iftex, --ifinfo...
  and --no-ifinfo... can be used instead.

* add http-equiv="Content-Type" tag for the charset declaration.

* HTML formatting is isolated in customizable functions located in the 
  initialization files. 

* menu comments are in a preformatted context.

* Any combination of caps for `top' leads to the top node.

* @ref{(perl)Top} leads to a ref to the info manual. 

* References to external manual in @ref and menus are links to the html 
  pages (with the same convention than makeinfo --html use).
  --html-xref-prefix is the base dir for external manual references.

* With --node-files do a file per node which can be used as a target for
  cross references from other manuals (including manuals generated with 
  makeinfo --html).

* With --use-nodes nodes are sectionning commands whe they are not associated
  with a structuring command.

* With --toc-links create links from headings to toc entries.

* distinct directions (next, prev...) for nodes and sections, more directions.

* split at chapter, section or for every node.

* new possibilities for buttons. If this is a ref to a scalar, the text 
  appears in navigation. If it is an array, the first element is a direction 
  used for the href, the second element is a scalar ref for the text.

* With --noseparated-footnotes the footnotes are in the same page than the
  text.

* %NO_TEXI hash similar with %HREF but without texinfo commands,
  %THISDOC{'title_no_texi'}

* "-U value" does the same than "@clear value".

* -P option prepends directory for include files before the document directory.

* -macro-expand generates a file with expanded macros and @include.

* pass $L2H_HTML_VERSION for the html version to latex2html.

* support for css. The --css-include option does the same than in makeinfo 
  (parse the file, and echo the @import part before the texi2html css rules, 
  the rules part after the texi2html css rules).
  The texi2html css commands may be customized too.

* Text before the first @node or sectionning command is part of the first
  section unless -ignore-preamble-text is set.

* if `-' is given to the -output option, output on STDOUT.

* Add images from the Singular project.

* All the strings appearing in the HTML are internationalized.

* centering and flushing is really handled.

* Format titlepage (even though the formatted text isn't used by default).

* Handle all the encodings perl knows about.

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

* @multitable size determination, out of bounds columns ignored.

* In @table and @itemize, @item is replaced by the @-command argument.

* nested @-commands are better handled. 

* in index keys @-commands are replaced by the right symbols.

* files are omitted in hrefs when they points to the same file.

* $value{_title}... are expanded during HTML generation.

* @H{a} leads to a'' and not &aacute; 

* cedilla are accepted in node names.

* Any characters are accepted in menu comments.

* frame target is the top file, and not the toc file.

* rewriting of the @macro code completely. This likely fixed some bugs but 
  this hasn't been verified by running the new, more complex test cases 
  against the old code.

* rewriting of the document structure resolution.
  unnumbered regions are at the right level and splitted indices don't break
  the document structure anymore.
  index entries and footnotes are more precisely located.

* @-commands ignored are ignored with the line, the arg or following spaces
  like makeinfo does.

* FOR DEVELOPERS
  --------------

* Standardized on Autoconf 2.59 & Automake 1.8.2

* The --enable-maintainer-mode option is now required by configure to enable
  what is considered the maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles.  This
  includes the portions which automatically rebuild the configure and build
  files (configure, aclocal, Makefile.in, etc) when configure.in or other
  dependencies are changed.

* The config is in the Texi2HTML::Config namespace. The latex2html related
  functions are in the Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML namespace. The 
  internationalization functions are in the Texi2HTML::I18n namespace in 
  T2h_i18n.pm.

1.66 (June 8 2002)
* Many bug fixes.

1.65 (August 26 2001)
* Many bug fixes.
* The operation of the previously broken << (FastBack) and >> (FastForward)
  buttons has changed slightly.  FastBack now returns to the beginning of the
  current chapter and FastForward now jumps to the beginning of the next
  chapter.

1.64 (July 3 2000)
* Incorporated first  version of Texi2html Texinfo manual, authored by
  Karl Heinz Marbaise <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
* New handling of command line options:
  - can be abbreviated to shortest unique prefix
  -help now works and is up-to-date

1.63 (June 23 2000)
* New customization variable: 
   $T2H_HREF_DIR_INSTEAD_FILE: 
       if set (e.g., to index.html) replace hrefs to this file 
        (i.e., to index.html) by ./
* New command-line option:
  -toc_file FILE 
       for those who want the TOC to be in FILE
* bug fixes related to macro invocation 
 
1.62 (12 April 2000)
* New customization variables: 
   $T2H_SPLIT_INDEX [default: = 100]
     index pages are split at next letter, if more than that many entries
   $T2H_NODE_NAME_IN_MENU [default = 0]
      for enforcing node names in meny entries
   $T2H_AVOID_MENU_REDUNDANCY [default = 1]
      to avoid display of duplicate meny entry information
   $T2H_INDEX_CHAPTER [default = '']
      if set, use chapter of this name for 'Index' Button in
      navigation bars, else use first chapter whose name matches
      "index" (case insensitive).
   $T2H_TOP_HEADING [ default = '']
      if non-empty, and no heading is in Top node, then use this as heading
      for top node/section; otherwise, use @settitle, @shorttitle.
* index generation: observes typesetting in fixed-width font, @ftable, 
  @vtable implemented
* Peter Moulder & Teun Burgers: Misc documentation and distribution
  changes
* numerous small bugs fixed (handling of menu entries, paragraphs in
  lists/tables, etc).


1.61 (31 March 2000)
* By default, $T2H_TOP_FILE is not set, and so $docu_name.html is used.
* Added T2H_print_chapter_header, T2H_print_chapter_footer for more
  fine-grained control of T2H_SPLIT eq 'chapter', added option
  -section_navigation, $T2H_SECTION_NAVIGATION to supress output of
  navigation panels per section
* naming scheme and calling convention of customizable subs changed:
  prefix T2H_, call &$T2H_, assignment $T2H_<name> = \&T2H_DEFAULT_<name>
* mailinglist created: texi2html@mathematik.uni-kl.de
* conversion to standard gnu package with Makefile.am, README,
  AUTHORS, etc. (Peter Moulder  <reiter@netspace.net.au>) 
* Initialization as suggested by Peter Moulder:
   1. /usr/local/etc/texi2htmlrc (or whatever given by --sysconfdir to
     configure)
   2. $HOME/.texi2htmlrc
   3. command-line options, including -init_file
  where later options override previous ones.
* incoporated patches from Peter Moulder (backward-compatible
  command-line options, separate man-page, etc).
* Automatic node pointer creation added
* @enddots, @exclamdown, @pounds, and relatives added.

Major Changes from 1.58 to 1.60
