	* tempfile.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.
	(RemoveTempFile): New function, to remove temporary file on exit.
	(MakeRWTempFile): Use "." as directory for temporary file on MSDOS
	as well.  Call RemoveTempFile instead of relying on it being
	unlinked when it is closed, on DOSISH systems.

	* seek.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.
	(CopyFile): Make sure the temporary file is put into the same mode
	(text or binary) as the original input handle.

	* dvitodvi.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.
	(main): Switch standard streams to binary mode when necessary.

	* dviselect.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.

	* dviconcat.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.
	(main): Switch standard streams to binary mode when necessary.

	* dvibook.c: Use text/binary parameterization from Kpathsea.

	* Makefile.in (prog_cflags): Add HAVE_CONFIG_H and -I with paths
	to Kpathsea directory.

	dviselect. No attempt to compile xtex! Made a configure file.
