@* Introduction. This program is a simple filter that inputs \TEX/ or \.{CWEB}
files and outputs its best guess at the ``words'' they contain. The word
list can then be passed to a spelling check routine such as {\tt wordtest}.

If this program is invoked with the name `{\tt excweb}', it will apply
special rules based on the syntax of \.{CWEB} files. Otherwise it will
use only the \TEX/ conventions. (Note that \UNIX/'s {\tt ln} command
allows a program to be invoked with more than one name although it
appears only once in the computer's memory.)

The \TEX/ conventions adopted here say that words are what remain
after you remove nonletters, control sequences,
comments triggered by \.\% marks, and material enclosed
within \.{\$...\$} or \.{\$\$...\$\$}. However, an apostrophe within
a word will be retained. The plain \TEX/ control
sequences for accented characters and special text characters, namely
$$\vbox{\halign{&\.{\\#}\hfil\qquad\cr
'&`&\relax\^&"&\relax\~&=&.&u&v\cr
H&t&c&d&b&oe&OE&ae&AE\cr
aa&AA&o&O&l&L&ss&i&j\cr}}$$
will also be retained, so that users can treat them as parts of words.
A blank space
following any of the alphabetic control sequences in this list will be carried
along too. If any of these control sequences is followed by \.\{, everything
up to the next \.\} will also be retained. Thus, for example, the
construction `\.{m\\=\{\\i\}n\\u\ us}' will be considered a single word,
in spite of the control sequences and the space between the two u's.
Discretionary hyphens `\.{\char`\\-}' are treated in the same way as accents.

The \.{CWEB} conventions are essentially the same as the \TEX/ conventions,
in the \TEX/ parts of a \.{CWEB} file. The \CEE/ parts of the file
are blanked out.

No attempt is made to reach a high level of artificial intelligence,
which would be able to truly understand the input file. Tricky users can
 confuse us. But we claim that devious tricks are their problem, not ours.

@ So here goes. The main idea is to keep a one-character lookahead
buffer, called |c|, which is set to zero when the character has been
processed. A giant switch to various cases, depending on the value of~|c|,
keeps everything moving.

If you don't like |goto| statements, don't read this. (And don't read
any other programs that simulate finite-state automata.)

    }

}

int save_skipping; /* value of |skipping| outside current \CEE/ mode */
register int cc; /* temporary buffer */

@* Simple cases.
Let's do some of the easiest things first, in order to get the hang of
this program. Several special characters will cause us to ignore everything
until the first appearance of something else.

@d discard_to(x) {@+while (get()!=x) ;@+}
@d discard_to_dol {@+for (cc=c,c=get();c!='$' || cc=='\\';cc=c,c=get())
     if (cc=='\\' && c==cc) c='\0';@+}

@<Special cases...@>=
case '%': discard_to('\n');@+goto restart;
case '$': c=getchar();
  if (c!='$') discard_to_dol@;
  else { /* after \.{\$\$} we discard everything to the next \.{\$\$} */
    do discard_to_dol@;
    while (getchar()!='$');
  }
  goto restart;

@ The `|get|' procedure in the code above is like \Cee's standard
`|getchar|', except that it immediately terminates execution at the end of
the input file. Otherwise malformed input files could lead to
infinite loops.

@<Procedures@>=
int get()
{@+register int x;
  x=getchar();
  if (x==EOF) exit(0);
  return x;
}
 
@ More complex behavior is handled by jumping out of the |switch| statement
to one of the routines following it. None of the cases say |break|, so
the code following the switch statement is accessible only via |goto|.

@<Special cases...@>=
case 'a': case 'A':
case 'b': case 'B':
case 'c': case 'C':
case 'd': case 'D':
case 'e': case 'E':
case 'f': case 'F':
case 'g': case 'G':
case 'h': case 'H':

goto out_word;

@ When letters appear in |stdin|, we pass them immediately through to |stdout|
with little further ado.
An apostrophe is rejected unless it is immediately followed by a letter.

@<Labeled code...@>=
out_word: putchar(c);
continue_word: c=getchar();
checkout_word:
if (isalpha(c)) goto out_word;
if (c=='\'') {

  }
  goto end_word;
}
if (c=='\\' && controlseq()) goto control_seq_in_word;
end_word: putchar('\n');
  goto main_cycle;

@* Control sequences.  The |controlseq()| function is the only
delicate part of this program.  After a backslash has been scanned,
|controlseq| looks to see if the next characters define one of the
special plain \TEX/ macros listed above. If so, the control sequence
and its immediately following argument (if any) are output and
|controlseq| returns a nonzero value. If not, nothing is output and
|controlseq| returns zero. In both cases the value of |c| will be
nonzero if and only if |controlseq| has had to look ahead at a
character it decided not to process.

@ @<Labeled code...@>=
control_seq_in_word: if (!c) goto continue_word;
goto checkout_word;

    l++;
    c=getchar();
    if (l==1) b=c;
  }
  if (l==0) c=getchar();
  @<Check for special plain \TEX/ control sequences;
    output them and |return 1| if found@>;
  return 0;
}

@ @d pair(x,y) (a==x && b==y)

@<Check for special...@>=
if ((a>='"' && a<='~' && ptab[a-'"']==l) ||
 (l==2 && (pair('a','e') || pair('A','E')@|
           || pair('o','e') || pair('O','E')@|
           || pair('a','a') || pair('A','A') || pair('s','s')))) {
  putchar('\\');
  putchar(a);
  if (l==2) putchar(b);
  if (l && c==' ') {
    putchar(' '); /* optional space after alphabetic control sequence */
    c=getchar();
  }
  if (c=='{') {
    do@+{putchar(c);
      c=get();
    }@+while (c!='}'); /* optional argument after special control sequence */
    putchar(c);
    c=0;
  }
  return 1;
}

special, otherwise~1; the conventions for letters are reversed.

  0,0,0,1,1,1,0}; /* \.{\\\~} */

@ In \.{CWEB} the \TEX/ control sequence `\.{\\.}' denotes the typewriter
font used for strings, not the dot-over accent. We must modify
|ptab| to reflect this unfortunate (but too-late-too-change) design decision.

@* CWEB considerations.
We're finished now with all that would be needed if we only wanted to
handle \TEX/. For \.{CWEB} a bit more should be done.

The \.{CWEB} escape character is \.{@@}, and the character following
it tells us what mode we should enter. In \TEX/ mode we should not
only do what we normally do for \TEX/ files, we should also ignore
material delimited by \.{\char"7C...\char"7C}, being careful to recognize when
|'|'| is part of a string (as it just was). And we should stop \TEX/
mode if we scan \.{*/} while in a \CEE/ comment.
