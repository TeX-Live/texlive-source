@*Introduction. This short program compiles a master index for a
set of programs that have been processed by \.{CTWILL}.
To use it, you say, e.g., \.{twinx} \.{*.tex} \.{>index.tex}.
The individual programs should define their names with a line of
the form `\.{\\def\\title\{NAME\}}'.

@* Data structures.
Our main task is to collate a bunch of texts associated with keys that
have already been sorted. It seems easiest to do this by repeatedly merging
the new data into the old, even though this means we'll be passing over
some of the same keys 30 times or more; the computer is fast, and this
program won't be run often.

Further examination shows that a merging strategy isn't so easy after all,
because the sorting done by \.{CTWILL} (and by \.{CWEAVE}) is weird
in certain cases. When two index entries agree except for their
``ilk,'' the order in which they appear in the index depends on the order in
which they appear in the program. Thus, they might well appear in
different order in two of the indexes we are merging.
(There's also another glitch, although not quite as devasting:
When two index entries have the
same letters and the same ilk, but differ with respect to uppercase
versus lowercase, the order in which they appear depends on the
hash code used in \.{CWEB}'s \.{common.w} code!)

So we'll use Plan B: All index entries will first be copied into a long
list. The list will almost always consist of many sorted sublists,
but we will not assume anything about its order. After all the copying
has been done, we will use a list-merge sort to finish the job.

The data structure is built from nodes that each contain three pointers.
The first pointer is to an |id| string; the third pointer is to the
|next| node; and the second pointer is either |data.s|, a pointer to
a string of text, or |data.n|, a pointer to a node. In the main list,
the |id| fields are the keys of the index, and the |data.n| fields
point to lists of associated texts. In the latter lists, the |id| fields
are the individual program titles, while the |data.s| fields are the
texts.

@<Type...@>=
typedef union {
  char *s;
  struct node_struct *n;
} mixed;
typedef struct node_struct {
  const char *id;
  mixed data;
  struct node_struct *next;
} node;

@ We copy strings into blocks of storage that are allocated as needed.
Here's a routine that stashes away a given string. It makes no attempt to
handle extremely long strings, because such strings will arise only
if the input is all screwed up.

@d string_block_size 8192 /* number of bytes per string block */

@<Proc...@>=
char *save_string(
  char *s)
{
  register char *p,*q; register int l;
  for (p=s;*p;p++) ;
  l=p-s+1;
  if (l>string_block_size) {
    fprintf(stderr,"twinx: Huge string `%.20s...' will be truncated!\n",s);
    l=string_block_size;
    s[l-1]='\0';
  }
  if (next_string+l>=bad_string) {
    next_string=(char*)malloc(string_block_size);
    if (next_string==NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr,"twinx: Not enough room for strings!\n");
      exit(-1);

@ We don't really have to initialize the string and node storage
pointers, because global variables are zero already. But we might as
well be tidy and state the initial conditions explicitly.

It will be convenient to have extremely small and large keys in
the dummy nodes.

@* Copying.
Lines in the index file |f| that we're reading either begin a new
entry or continue a long entry. In the first case, the line begins with
\.{\\I} and then either \.{\\\\\{key\}} or \.{\\\char'174\{key\}} or
\.{\\.\{key\}} or \.{\\\&\{key\}} or \.{\\\$\{key\}} or \.{\\9\{key\}}
or just \.{\ \ \{key\}}. (These correspond to multi-character italic,
single-digit italic, typewriter, bold, custom, variable, and roman styles.)
In the second case, the line begins with a page number or \.{\\[};
however, we recognize the second case by the fact that the previous line
did not end with a period.

@<Copy the index...@>=
while (1) {@+register node *cur_node;

            buf,*argv);
}

@ @<Copy a new index entry...@>=
if (buf[4]!='{') {
  fprintf(stderr,"twinx: missing brace in file %s: `%.20s...'\n",*argv,buf);
  break;
}
{@+register char *p,*q;@+register int bal=1;
  cur_name[0]=buf[2];@+cur_name[1]=buf[3];@+cur_name[2]='{';
  for (p=buf+5,q=cur_name+3;*p&&(bal||*p=='{');p++) {
    if (*p=='{') bal++;
    else if (*p=='}') bal--;
    *q++=*p;
  }
  if (bal) {
    fprintf(stderr,"twinx: unbalanced entry in file %s: `%.20s...'\n",*argv,buf);
    break;
  }

  }
  *q='\0';
  @<Copy the text part of the index entry into |cur_node|@>;
}

@ When we get here, |p| points to the beginning of the text following a key
in the index. The index entry ends with the next period, possibly several
lines hence. In the multiple-line case, |cur_node| will point to the
final line, which points to the penultimate line, etc.

@<Copy the text part of the index entry...@>=

    fprintf(stderr,"twinx: File %s ended in middle of entry for %s!\n",
        *argv,cur_name);
    break;
  }
}

@* Sorting.
Let us opt for simplicity instead of tuning up for speed. The idea in
this step is to take a list that contains $k$ ascending runs and reduce it
to a list that contains $\lceil k/2\rceil$ runs, repeating until $k=1$.
We could make the program about twice as fast if we took the trouble to
remember the boundaries of runs on the previous pass; here, every
pass will be the same.

@<Output the data structures to make a master index@>=
@<Sort the main list, collapsing entries with the same |id|@>;
@<Output the main list in suitable \TeX\ format@>;

@ The |compare| subroutine, which specifies the relative order of
|id| fields in two nodes, appears below. Let's get the sorting logic
right first.

The algorithm is, in fact, rather pretty---I hate to say cute, but
that's the word that comes to mind. Some day I must write out the
nice invariant relations in these loops. Too bad it's not more efficient.

Remember that |header.id| is $-\infty$ and |sentinel.id| is $+\infty$.
Also remember that the main list begins and ends at the header node.

@<Sort the main list, collapsing entries with the same |id|@>=
main_node->next=&header;
while (1) {@+register node *p,*q,*r,*s,*t;
  t=&header;
  r=t->next;
  while (1) {
    if (r==&header) break;
    p=s=r;
    @<Advance |s| until it exceeds |r=s->next|@>;
    if (r==&header) break;
    s->next=&sentinel;
    q=s=r;
    @<Advance |s| until it exceeds |r=s->next|@>;
    s->next=&sentinel;
    @<Merge |p| and |q|, appending to |t|@>;
    t->next=r;
  }
  if (t==&header) break;
}

@ @<Advance...@>=
do@+{@+register int d;
  r=s->next;
  d=compare(s,r);
  if (d>0) break; /* |s->id>r->id| */
  if (d==0) { /* |s->id=r->id| */
    collapse(s,r); /* put |r|'s data into |s|'s list */
    s->next=r->next; /* node |r| will be unclaimed garbage */
  } else s=r; /* this is the normal case, |s->id<r->id| */
}@+while(1);

@ Merging takes place in such a way that sorting is stable.
Thus, index entries for a key that appears in different programs
will remain in the order of the \.{.tex} files on the command line.

@<Merge...@>=
do@+{@+register int d;
  d=compare(p,q);
  if (d>0) { /* |p->id>q->id| */
    t->next=q;
    t=q;
    q=q->next;
  } else if (d<0) { /* |p->id<q->id| */
    t->next=p; /* |p->id<q->id| */
    t=p;
    p=p->next;
  } else if (p==&sentinel) break;
  else {
    collapse(p,q); /* put |q|'s data into |p|'s list */
    q=q->next;
  }
}@+while(1);

@ Comparison is a three-stage process in general. First we compare the
keys without regarding case or format type. If they are equal with
respect to that criterion, we try again, with case significant.
If they are still equal, we look at the format characters (the first
two characters of the |id| field).

@<Proc...@>=
int compare(
  node *p, node *q)
{@+register unsigned char *pp,*qq;
  for (pp=(unsigned char*)p->id+3,qq=(unsigned char*)q->id+3;
      *pp&&ord[*pp]==ord[*qq];pp++,qq++) ;
  if (*pp || *qq) return ord[*pp]-ord[*qq];
  for (pp=(unsigned char*)p->id+3,qq=(unsigned char*)q->id+3;
      *pp&&*pp==*qq;pp++,qq++) ;
  if (*pp || *qq) return (int)*pp-(int)*qq;
  if (p->id[0]!=q->id[0]) return p->id[0]-q->id[0];
  return p->id[1]-q->id[1];
}  

@ The collation order follows a string copied from \.{CWEAVE}.

@<Glob...@>=
char collate[102]; /* collation order */
char ord[256]; /* rank in collation order */

@ The right brace is placed lowest in collating order, because each
key is actually followed by a right brace when we are sorting.

Apology: I haven't had time to update this part of the program to
allow 8-bit characters. At present the data is assumed to be
7-bit ASCII, as it was in the early versions of \.{CWEAVE}.

@<Init...@>=
collate[0]=0; strcpy(collate+1,"} \1\2\3\4\5\6\7\10\11\12\13\14\15\16\17\
\20\21\22\23\24\25\26\27\30\31\32\33\34\35\36\37\

{@+register int j;
  for (j=1;collate[j];j++) ord[(int)collate[j]]=j;
  ord[128]=j; /* this affects the ordering of |sentinel.id| */
  for (j='A';j<='Z';j++) ord[j]=ord[tolower(j)];
}

@ When two lists are combined, we put the data from the second node
before the data from the first node, because we are going to reverse
the order when printing. After this procedure has acted, the field
|q->data.n| should not be considered an active pointer.
