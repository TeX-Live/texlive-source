  Congratulations! You have now installed the gregorio typesetting 
  system. Gregorio has no Graphical user interface, it's made to be 
  integrated in a TeX typesetting process.

  To start creating scores, you can now configure TeXworks for Gregorio,
  see http://gregorio-project.github.io/introduction-editor.html for
  a small guide through the score compilation process.

  (Optional) If you want to install the Gregorio Support for Scribus, please
  copy the file 900_Gregorio.xml from the contrib\ directory of the installation
  directory of Gregorio (ex: C:\Program Files\Gregorio\contrib)
  into the share\editorconfig\ directory of your Scribus install
  (ex: C:\Program Files\Scribus-x.y.z\share\editorconfig).
