This TeX Live directory contains the programs that use the kpathsea
library for configuration and path searching, and the library itself.

Some programs can be built on their own, but others, including kpathsea
itself, cannot.  Instead, try configure --enable-tetex-build in .., or
using the Build script there.  In general, for TeX Live we only test
configuring the whole tree.
