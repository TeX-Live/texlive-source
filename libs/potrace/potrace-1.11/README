	   POTRACE - transform bitmaps into vector graphics
			
				* * *
	   
DESCRIPTION

 Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
 bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM,
 PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector
 file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned
 data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
 The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can
 then be rendered at any resolution.

 Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
 PostScript, PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), DXF, GeoJSON, PGM
 (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and
 XFig. Additional backends might be added in the future.

 A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act
 as a pre-processor for Potrace, applying scaling and various filters
 to an image before converting it to a bitmap. This is useful for
 potracing greyscale and color images.

DEPENDENCIES

 Potrace relies on the zlib library for PostScript level 3
 compression. This library is pre-installed on most modern systems. 
 If not present, it can be obtained from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/.

COMPILATION

 For generic compilation instructions, see the file INSTALL.  In
 addition, the following compile time options (options to ./configure)
 are supported. 

  --with-libpotrace       install Potrace library and headers (default: no)
  --disable-zlib          disable PostScript level 3 compression
  --enable-metric         use metric units (centimeters) as default
  --enable-a4             use a4 as the default papersize
  --enable-dumb-tty       use simplified ASCII-only progress bar

 See also ./configure --help.

INSTALLING

 If you are installing from sources, just do "make install" as root.
 If you are installing from a binary distribution, just copy the
 "potrace" and "mkbitmap" binaries to a place where the operating
 system expects them, such as /usr/local/bin. Also copy the files
 "potrace.1" and "mkbitmap.1" to a directory where the operating
 system looks for man pages, such as /usr/local/man/man1. For
 instructions on installing Potrace under Windows, see the file
 README-WIN

POTRACE LIBRARY (FOR DEVELOPERS)

 As of Potrace release 1.6, the Potrace core functionality has been
 separated into a library libpotrace.a. This makes it easy to integrate
 tracing functionality into other GPL programs. The API of the library
 is defined in the header file potracelib.h, and is documented in
 doc/potracelib.pdf. It is not by default installed, but can be
 installed with the --with-libpotrace configuration option.
