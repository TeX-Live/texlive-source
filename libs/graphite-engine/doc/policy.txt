POLICIES

This document keeps a dated list of policy changes that we may come up with
or recind or generally do whatever we want with. There's no carefully worked
out framework in which these policies sit, they are just rules we intend
to keep and break when we need to!

API Changes Policy

Any changes to the public API will be documented on the developers' list along
with a branch into which the corresponding code changes will be placed.
Following the announcement, the branch will not be merged into the trunk for
at least 1 week. After which, depending on how the development has gone and
the comments or otherwise, the merge may: take place unannounced, be delayed
unannounced or be dropped and not take place, in which case an announcement
will be made on the developers' list.
