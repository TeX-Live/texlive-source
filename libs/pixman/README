	Building pixman-0.28.0 as part of the TL tree
	=============================================

This directory libs/pixman/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the pixman
library 'libpixman' from the unmodified source tree in
libs/pixman/pixman-x.y.z/, bypassing the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/pixman/pixman-x.y.z/configure have
been translated into equivalent test in libs/pixman/configure.ac.
