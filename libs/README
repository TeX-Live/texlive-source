====================

Apart from descending into the various subdirectories, this sub-package
'libs' creates two files ../subdir-configure and ../subdir-conf.args.  They
allow the top-level Makefile to properly configure ../utils and ../texk
without the need to adjust the absolute or relative paths to the respective
source directories (as already done by configure for this directory).
