For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.
To make without configuring, run TL_CONFIGURE=true ./Build.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see all the names.)

Prerequisites:
- C and C++ compilers.

- GNU make.  If your GNU make is invoked by some name other than `make',
  try: env TL_MAKE=/your/gnu/make ./Build

- GNU clisp and GNU libffcall, for xindy.  See more
  details in utils/README.  (Alternative: Build --disable-xindy.)
  Also perl, latex, and pdflatex to build the rules and/or documentation.

- Perl to autodetect the TeX Live platform name for biber.

- X11 headers and libraries (often a ``development'' package, not
  installed by default), for pdfopen and xdvi.
  (Alternative: Build --without-x.)

- libfontconfig (again both headers and library), for XeTeX,
  except on MacOSX.  (Alternative: Build --disable-xetex.)
  While on MacOSX, an Objective C++ compiler is needed for XeTeX.

- If you modify any .y or .l source files, then Bison and Flex (or maybe
  equivalents) are needed.  The distributed .c and .h files are generated
  with bison-3.0 and flex-2.5.37.

The binaries will be left in ./inst/bin/<stdplatform>.
For TeX Live, ignore the other files and directories that end up in ./inst.

The new binaries are not directly usable from that location.  Instead,
copy them to Master/bin/<tlplatformname>/.

That should be it for normal builds.  Email tex-live@tug.org if problems.

To make a usable TeX installation, you have to have (thousands of)
support files as well as the binaries that are built here.  The support
files are maintained completely independently.  The best basis for
dealing with them is the TeX Live (plain text) database,
Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, and/or our installer.  More information is
under Master/tlpkg.  See also http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html.

If your C++ needs to find the standard library in, say, /usr/local/lib,
(i.e., configure fails saying the compiler doesn't work), try:
env LD_OPTIONS=-R/usr/local/lib ./Build

Many more details about the TL build system, such as adding new
programs or libraries, recompiling after fixing problems, etc., are in
doc/texlive.pdf and in the other README.* files here.


Build information for some of the platforms.

i386-linux: gcc 4.8.2, Linux 2.6.18-* (CentOS 5.10, tug.org)
  ~karl/bin/mybuild
        
x86_64-linux: gcc 4.8.2, libc 2.3.6, Linux 2.6.28.6
  
amd64-netbsd:
  gcc version 4.5.3 (NetBSD nb2 20110806)
  NetBSD/amd64 6.1.3
  TL_MAKE=gmake LDFLAGS='-L/usr/X11R7/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/X11R7/lib' ./Build

*-kfreebsd:  the builder says ...
  I do not have any native kfreebsd systems. The best way to build is
  to run a clean kfreebsd "userland" within a jail.  I am running Debian
  "stable" kfreebsd userland under a freebsd 10.0 real system. Thus, I
  produced 32bit i386-kfreebsd binaries above ("./Build").
  
  I also tried, but am planning on dropping, running Debian "stable"
  kfreebsd installed on a virtual machine via VirtualBox. Thus, I
  produced 64bit amd64-kfreebsd binaries above.
  
  I tested that the freebsd binaries will *not* run on a kfreebsd
  "userland" and the kfreebsd binaries will *not* run on a freebsd
  "userland". Whereas I would have thought them to be somewhat
  interchangeable, they are linked to libraries (ELF interpreter ld.so.1)
  and maybe others) that are to be found in different locations on the
  different systems.
  
i386-solaris, x86_64-solaris: Solaris 10.

i386-cygwin, x86_64-cygwin: gcc-4.8.2, cygwin-1.7.29.
  ./Build (with --enable-xindy for i386).

  Linux homer 2.6.32-5-powerpc64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 8 02:01:42 UTC 2011
  ppc64 Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
  (only the kernel is 64bit, the entire userland is 32bit)

sparc-solaris: gcc-4.5.0, Solaris 5.10 (Utah).
